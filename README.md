Setup Guide coming soon.

User:pass proxies situation is resolved.

Temporary Guide:

Download Python 3.7

During the installtion you will be asked if you would like to "add python 3.7 to path" click that checkbox and continue installation(very essential step)

Open command prompt

Type python --version if you receive an error and not the version of python you jus downloaded, please repeat the installation step above.

Copy paste these commands into your command prompt.

pip install selenium

pip install fake-useragent

pip install concurrent-utils

These will take a few seconds to a few minutes depending on your machine and internet connection.

Make sure all the files downloaded from github are all under one folder.

Fill the proxies.txt file with proxies in the corresponding format(ignore the config.txt file).

Now all you need to do is run ui.py and fill out the text fields and click the launch button!

Please create an issue  if an issue arises.

PS: Do not run an excessive amount of tasks.
